# Pullers

We have implemented several example of `pullers` programs that will
fetch the results. The idea of the pullers is to provide basic example
of how to retreive the results of vjoule service from a program.

There are four example in the repository : 
- a bash example, that simply prints the cpu consumption of the System and of the vjoule service
- a c++ example, that prints the consumption of the different components (cpu, ram and gpu) of the system and all the cgroup watched by the service
- a rust example, that prints the consumption of the different components (cpu, ram and gpu) of the system and all the cgroup watched by the service
- a python example, that retreives the consumption of the different components (cpu, ram and gpu) of the system and all the cgroup watched by the service and plot them to a image file when Ctrl-C is pressed.
