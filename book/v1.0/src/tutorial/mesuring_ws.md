# Evaluate a web service
In the previous tutorial, we used both CLI and service version of vJoule to measure the energy consummed by the execution of a python script. In this tutorial, we are going to build a bit more complex scenario. 

We are going to monitor the energy consumption of a web server and a database on docker containers. We will consider here that both vJoule sensor and formula services are running.

## Setting up our environment
Starting docker containers

## Monitoring the energy consumption
Creating a cgroup hierarchy
