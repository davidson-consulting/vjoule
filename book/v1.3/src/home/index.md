# Welcome to vJoule's documentation

The environmental costs of the software and infrastructure they build and deploy
are increasingly important to developers today. However, the collection of
energy consumption data from machines can be time consuming and is generally
hardware dependent.

vJoule is a tool that interfaces multiple sources of energy consumption and
centralizes all energy readings in one place to provide a higher abstraction for
developers and to help measure energy consumption. This document will give you
all the information you need to have a successful start with vJoule.

vJoule is a tool developed at Davidson Consulting and inspired by other tools
like PowerAPI.
