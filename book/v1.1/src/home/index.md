# Welcome to vJoule's documentation

Nowadays, developers are more and more aware of the environmental cost
of the software and infrastructures they build and deploy.

vJoule is a tool that allows you to measure the energy consumptions of
running processes. Under the hood, vJoule will estimate the energy
consumption of all monitored processes based on the current energy
consumption measured on your computer.

You will find here all the informations you need to get started with

vJoule is a tool developed at Davidson Consulting and inspired by
